# About
A forensic geneticist by academia, I conduct research that lies at the intersection of anthropology, population
genetics and wildlife forensics. I am specifically driven by the interaction between the socio-cultural evolution
and genetic ancestry of human populations in western Himalayan region of India. With strong analytical and
written communication skills, I have communicated my research findings to the larger scientific community.
